## 📌 Overview
The **Ethical AI Advisor** is a Python-based tool that helps developers, researchers, and organizations **assess the ethical risks** of their AI systems, datasets, and code.  

It leverages **NLP**, **fairness toolkits**, and **privacy checks** to provide actionable recommendations around:  
- ⚖️ **Fairness** (bias detection, group parity)  
- 🔍 **Transparency** (explainable results and summaries)  
- 🔒 **Privacy** (PII detection, sensitive attributes)  
- 📜 **Compliance** (aligning with ethical AI guidelines like GDPR, OECD, IEEE)

## ✨ Key Features
- 📝 **Text/Model Description Analysis** – Scan AI project descriptions for ethical risks  
- 💻 **Code Audit** – Detect unsafe practices (hardcoded secrets, logging PII, etc.)  
- 📊 **Dataset Checks** – Explore missing values, bias, and protected attributes  
- ⚖️ **Fairness Metrics** – (optional) integrates with IBM **AI Fairness 360**  
- 🤝 **Conversational Agent** – Ask questions like *“What are the risks?”* or *“How fair is this dataset?”*  
- 🗂 **Audit Logs** – Save JSON audit reports for governance & transparency  
- 🌐 **Dual Interface** – Use via **CLI** or as a **Flask API server**
